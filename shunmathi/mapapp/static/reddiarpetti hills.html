                Reddiarpatti Hills in Tirunelveli isn't a major tourist destination like Manjolai,
                 but it's a notable locality/hillock near Tirunelveli city (Pin Code 627007), known for its accessible location and
                  proximity to urban amenities, serving as a backdrop to the town, and being part of the broader Tirunelveli region known for Western Ghats views,
                   sacred sites (like Nellaiappar Temple), and natural beauty like Manimuthar Falls.
