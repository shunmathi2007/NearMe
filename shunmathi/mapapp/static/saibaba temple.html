             The main Sai Baba Temple in Tirunelveli is the Shri Kubera Sai Baba Temple at Reddiarpatti, 
             known for its peaceful atmosphere, beautiful white marble idol, and special poojas on Thursdays,
              offering city views and rejuvenation, with good accessibility. 
              Key points include its location near the Kanyakumari Highway, serene environment, sub-shrines (Ganesha,
               Dattatreya, Gayatri), clean premises, and popularity, especially on auspicious Thursdays for devotees 
               seeking peace and positive vibes.
